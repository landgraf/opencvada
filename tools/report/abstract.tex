Under development at Mälardalens Högskola is a Field-programmable Gate Array camera system for computer stereo vision. To ease the testing and development of said system, Ada bindings for the Open Source Computer Vision library was designed and implemented. These bindings together with a communication protocol for the device will allow for testing algorithms on images from the camera system. This will allow for the testing algorithms without writing the VHDL code this should speed up development and make sure algorithms are properly tested.
\\
To make this a possibility we have worked on finding the best ways of interfacing C and C++ code with Ada. Then with that knowledge we created bindings for Ada to the C version of Open Source Computer Vision library, The C version was chosen due to the limitations of interfacing C++ with Ada that are discussed in the report. Also benchmarks was created to test the performance of the Ada version compared to C and Python. From the benchmarks we found that the performance results between C and Ada is about equal, sometimes the Ada performance is better and other times the C performance is better while the Python bindings are a bit behind in all cases.
